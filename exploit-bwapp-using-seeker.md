**SQLmap** is a very good tool for SQL injection and it is very versatile and very powerful.

For a sizable website which receives many user inputs and generates lots of database queries, using SQLmap to detect and validate all possible SQL injections vulnerabilities is still a challenge.

Recall the manual steps during our bWAPP SQL injection experiment earlier:

\*\* the effort to identify all injection end points;

\*\* the effort to cope with all authentication mechanism like cache, user login, etc;

\*\* the effort to correlate query statement with actual database structure;

\*\* the effort to validate that injection exploit actually works for the underlying database.
