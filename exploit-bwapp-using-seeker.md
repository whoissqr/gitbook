**SQLmap** is a very good tool for SQL injection and it is very versatile and very powerful.

However, as a pen tester or white hat, for a sizable website which receives many user inputs at many pages and generates lots of database queries, using SQLmap to detect and validate all possible SQL injections vulnerabilities can still a challenge.



Recall the manual steps during our bWAPP SQL injection experiment earlier:

\*\* the effort to identify all injection end points;

\*\* the effort to cope with all authentication mechanism like cache, user login, etc;

\*\* the effort to correlate query statement with actual database structure;

\*\* the effort to validate that injection exploit actually works for the underlying database.



Are there any good tools in the market which tried to manage this task automatically?
